1. Installation

Just deploy .gs files from scripts/utils/ on the Google Drive which will be used to run the application. 
Copy settings.json from scripts/ to the Google Drive as well.

Deploy using: Publish -> Deploy as a web app -> Run as me, anyone even anonymous has access to the app.

Then change the MACRO_URLs from the scripts/settings.js.
